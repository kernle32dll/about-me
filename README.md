# about-me

Hi, I'm Bj√∂rn. Also known as Kernle 32DLL, or nowadays mostly just Kernle. Yes, with le. I am not the Linux kernel.

I'm a German software developer. I do mostly web development, but I also occasionally dip my feet into mobile apps,
IoT and hardware design.

## My stuff

I do some open source development. Here are some Go stuff I developed:
